Hello,
I'm Lucas and thanks for help me.
i just found out about github so i'm not very good on how the site works so if you have experience and want to help i would be happy to answer you.

Otherwise I am French so the text and some tags are in French because I did not think to put it on github so sorry.

The theme of the web site is the film "Black Panther"
If you want to work with an another theme, create a new page on the website and have fun :) 

at the beginning, the site was a school assignment and it is for this that the site has a weird name.

thank you for all the people who collaborate in this project
