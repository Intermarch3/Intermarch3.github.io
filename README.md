## Hello

I'm Lucas and i'm 15 years old.

My goal is to created a beautiful web-site and learning code for my futur working because i want to be a dev :) 

The theme of the web site is the film "Black Panther"
at the beginning, the site was a school assignment and it is for this that the site has a weird name.

For anyone who wants to see the website, open the GeneralHome.html page to access the rest of the site
if you have any problems or questions, do not hesitate in the comments area.
