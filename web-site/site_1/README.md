## Hello 👋
### This website is the first of my life.
It's a website requested by my technology teatcher but i improve it in my way.😊

### It's a website about the movie "black Panther" 🎞
it consists of 3 pages :
- The menu 🏠 which contain the picture of the director and other information.
- The synopsis 🔍 which contain the film resume and other important information.
- The casting 🤸‍♂️ which contain the 7 main character with his actor and a short biography of the character in the movie.


#### It is highly likely that there are text overflow or other problems if you visit it on a phone or tablet.😅
I tried to fix the errors but some required the redesign of the HTML, to keep the charm of my very first site (and by laziness), I did not fix certain bugs voluntarily (don't worry, there are not many ).
### I hope you like my work
#### Don't hesitate to give me your opinion.
